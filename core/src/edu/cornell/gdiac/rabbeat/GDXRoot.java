/*
 * GDXRoot.java
 *
 * This is the primary class file for running the game.  It is the "static main" of
 * LibGDX.  In the first lab, we extended ApplicationAdapter.  In previous lab
 * we extended Game.  This is because of a weird graphical artifact that we do not
 * understand.  Transparencies (in 3D only) is failing when we use ApplicationAdapter. 
 * There must be some undocumented OpenGL code in setScreen.
